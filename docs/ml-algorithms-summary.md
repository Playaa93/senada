# ML Algorithms Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a complete intelligent restock prediction system for the Senada perfume inventory app using pure TypeScript algorithms optimized for Cloudflare Workers runtime. No external ML libraries required.

## Files Created

### 1. `/workers/src/ml/forecasting.ts` (450 lines)
Time series analysis and demand forecasting algorithms.

**Algorithms Implemented:**
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** - Smooths data by averaging over a window
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** - Weights recent data more heavily (α = 2/(period+1))
- **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)** - Linear weights, most recent = highest
- **Linear Regression** - Least squares trend analysis with R² calculation
- **Seasonality Detection** - Autocorrelation analysis to find repeating patterns
- **Seasonal Indices** - Calculate seasonal multipliers for each period
- **Demand Variance** - Standard deviation and coefficient of variation
- **Hybrid Forecast** - Combines SMA (30%) + EMA (40%) + Trend (30%) with confidence scoring
- **Sales Velocity** - Units per day/week/month calculation

**Key Features:**
- Handles sparse data gracefully
- Confidence scoring based on data quality and variance
- Detects increasing/decreasing/stable trends
- Seasonality detection via autocorrelation (perfume gifting seasons)

### 2. `/workers/src/ml/inventory-optimizer.ts` (550 lines)
Inventory management and optimization algorithms.

**Algorithms Implemented:**
- **Reorder Point (ROP)** - `(Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock`
- **Safety Stock** - Z-score based buffer stock for service levels (95%, 99%)
- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** - `√((2 × D × S) / H)` minimizes total costs
- **ABC Classification** - Pareto analysis (A=80% revenue, B=15%, C=5%)
- **Dead Stock Detection** - Identifies products with no sales in 90+ days
- **Turnover Ratio** - `COGS / Average Inventory` velocity metric
- **Days of Supply** - How long current stock will last
- **Inventory Health Assessment** - Multi-metric scoring (turnover, risk, status)
- **Optimal Order Quantity with Discounts** - Considers price breaks and total cost
- **Replenishment Strategy Recommendation** - Continuous/periodic/min-max based on ABC class

**Key Features:**
- Accounts for variable lead times
- Service level Z-score lookup (80%-99%)
- Price break optimization
- Storage capacity constraints
- Risk assessment (dead stock, understock)

### 3. `/workers/src/ml/restock-predictor.ts` (600 lines)
Main prediction engine integrating all algorithms.

**Core Functionality:**
- **Single Product Prediction** - Complete analysis with recommendations
- **Batch Prediction** - Process multiple products efficiently
- **Priority Ranking** - Sort by urgency, ABC class, confidence
- **Perfume-Specific Adjustments** - Seasonality, luxury category, gifting periods, trends

- **Summary** - Daily overview (low priority)

## Algorithm Examples

### Example 1: Basic Forecasting

**Input:**
```typescript
const salesData = [10, 12, 15, 11, 14, 16, 13, 17, 19, 15];
const forecast = hybridForecast(salesData, 7);
```

**Output:**
```typescript
{
  predicted: 16.8,           // Expected next day sales
  confidence: 0.78,          // 78% confidence
  trend: 'increasing',       // Upward trend
  seasonalityFactor: 1.0     // No seasonality detected
}
```

### Example 2: Reorder Point Calculation

**Input:**
```typescript
const metrics = {
  averageDemand: 15,         // 15 units/day
  demandVariability: 3.5,    // Std dev
  leadTime: 7,               // 7 days from supplier
  serviceLevel: 0.95         // 95% target
};
const rop = calculateReorderPoint(metrics);
```

**Calculation:**
```
Average Demand During Lead Time = 15 × 7 = 105 units
Z-score for 95% service level = 1.65
Safety Stock = 1.65 × 3.5 × √7 = 15.3 ≈ 16 units
ROP = 105 + 16 = 121 units
```

**Output:**
```typescript
{
  rop: 121,
  safetyStock: 16,
  averageDemandDuringLeadTime: 105,
  confidence: 0.73
}
```

### Example 3: Economic Order Quantity

**Input:**
```typescript
const eoq = calculateEOQ(
  5475,  // Annual demand (15 units/day × 365)
  50,    // Ordering cost per order
  25     // Holding cost per unit per year (unit cost × 25%)
);
```

**Calculation:**
```
EOQ = √((2 × 5475 × 50) / 25)
    = √(547,500 / 25)
    = √21,900
    = 148 units
```

**Total Annual Cost:**
```
Purchase Cost = 5475 × $100 = $547,500
Ordering Cost = (5475 / 148) × $50 = $1,850
Holding Cost = (148 / 2) × $25 = $1,850
Total = $551,200
```

### Example 4: Complete Restock Prediction

**Input Product:**
```typescript
{
  productId: 'PERF001',
  name: 'Chanel No. 5 EDP 100ml',
  currentStock: 25,
  unitCost: 80,
  sellingPrice: 150,
  supplierLeadTime: 14,
  minimumOrderQuantity: 12
}
```

**Sales History (30 days):**
```typescript
Daily sales: [2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3]
Average: 2.97 units/day
Trend: Stable
Variance: Low (CV = 0.28)
```

**Prediction Output:**
```typescript
{
  productId: 'PERF001',
  productName: 'Chanel No. 5 EDP 100ml',
  currentStock: 25,
  daysOfSupply: 8.4,                    // 25 / 2.97

  shouldReorder: true,                   // Yes, reorder now
  recommendedOrderQuantity: 72,          // Optimized with price break
  reorderPoint: 50,                      // ROP = (3 × 14) + 8
  safetyStock: 8,                        // Buffer stock
  urgency: 'high',                       // Stock low

  predictedDemand: {
    daily: 2.97,
    weekly: 20.8,

  estimatedValue: 3750,                  // 25 × $150

  abcClass: 'A',                         // High-value item

  inventoryHealth: {
    turnoverRatio: 8.2,                  // Fast-moving
    daysOfSupply: 8.4,
    deadStockRisk: 0.05,                 // 5% risk (low)
    understockRisk: 0.68,                // 68% risk (high)
    optimalStatus: 'warning'
  },

  replenishmentStrategy: {
    strategy: 'continuous-review',
    reviewPeriod: 1,                     // Daily monitoring
    reasoning: 'High-value item requires continuous monitoring'
  },

  estimatedStockoutDate: '2025-11-03',  // 8 days from now
  recommendedOrderDate: '2025-10-26',   // Order today
  expectedDeliveryDate: '2025-11-09',   // Arrives in 14 days

  warnings: [
    'Stock approaching critical levels',
    'Estimated stockout in 8 days'
  ],

  insights: [
    'Bulk discount available: $75.00 per unit (save $360)',
    'High turnover ratio (8.2) - fast-moving item',
    'Class A item requires tight inventory control'
  ]
}
```

### Example 5: Perfume-Specific Adjustments

**Base Prediction:**
```typescript
recommendedOrderQuantity: 72
safetyStock: 8
```

**Adjustments for Luxury + Holiday Season + Trending:**
```typescript
const adjusted = restockPredictor.adjustForPerfumeMarket(prediction, {
  category: 'luxury',        // +30% safety stock
  season: 'winter',          // +20% demand
  isGiftSeason: true,        // +50% order quantity
  trendingScore: 0.85        // +40% safety stock
});
```

**Adjusted Output:**
```typescript
recommendedOrderQuantity: 108,  // 72 × 1.5 (gift season)
safetyStock: 14,               // 8 × 1.3 × 1.4 (luxury + trending)
predictedDemand: {
  daily: 3.56,                 // 2.97 × 1.2 (winter)
  weekly: 24.9,
  monthly: 106.8
}
```

## Performance Characteristics
