## Example ADR: Database Choice

# ADR-004: Use Drizzle ORM with Cloudflare D1

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Deciders**: @tech-lead, @backend-team
**Technical Story**: #42

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for type-safe database access with Cloudflare D1. The ORM should provide excellent TypeScript support, minimal runtime overhead, and good developer experience.

**Key Considerations**:
- Type safety from schema to queries
- Performance impact on edge runtime
- Local development experience
- Migration management
- Visual database tools

## Decision Drivers

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript inference without code generation
- **Performance**: Minimal runtime overhead (<5ms)
- **DX**: Visual database management and migration tools
- **D1 Support**: First-class Cloudflare D1 integration
- **Team Expertise**: Team familiar with TypeScript, prefer code-first approach

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Drizzle ORM

**Description**: Lightweight TypeScript ORM with zero runtime overhead

**Pros**:
- ✅ Full TypeScript inference from schema
- ✅ Zero runtime overhead (compiles to SQL)
- ✅ Drizzle Studio for visual DB management
- ✅ Git-tracked migrations
- ✅ Excellent Cloudflare D1 support

**Cons**:
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem than Prisma
- ❌ Some advanced features still in development
- ❌ Less community resources

**Cost**: Low learning curve, minimal performance impact
**Risk**: Low

### Option 2: Prisma

**Description**: Popular TypeScript ORM with code generation

**Pros**:
- ✅ Large ecosystem and community
- ✅ Prisma Studio for DB management
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Advanced features (relations, aggregations)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Code generation step required
- ❌ Larger bundle size (~500KB)
- ❌ Runtime overhead (query engine)
- ❌ Limited D1 support (experimental)

**Cost**: Medium learning curve, higher performance impact
**Risk**: Medium

### Option 3: Kysely

**Description**: Type-safe SQL query builder

**Pros**:
- ✅ Lightweight and fast
- ✅ Full TypeScript support
- ✅ Flexible query building

**Cons**:
- ❌ No visual database tools
- ❌ Manual migration management
- ❌ More verbose than ORMs

**Cost**: Low performance impact, higher development time
**Risk**: Low

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Option 1: Drizzle ORM"

**Rationale**:
Drizzle ORM provides the best balance of type safety, performance, and developer experience for our edge-first architecture. The zero runtime overhead is critical for Cloudflare Workers, and Drizzle Studio provides the visual management we need. While the ecosystem is smaller than Prisma, the first-class D1 support and superior performance outweigh this concern.

**Expected Consequences**:

**Positive**:
- ✅ Type-safe queries with full inference
- ✅ No performance overhead in Workers
- ✅ Excellent local development with Drizzle Studio
- ✅ Simple migration workflow

**Negative**:
- ⚠️ May need to build some utilities (less community packages)
- ⚠️ Team needs to learn Drizzle's query syntax

**Neutral**:
- ℹ️ Migration from Drizzle to another ORM would be straightforward if needed

## Implementation Plan

**Steps**:
1. Install Drizzle ORM and D1 adapter
2. Create initial schema in `drizzle/schema.ts`
3. Generate first migration
4. Set up Drizzle Studio for local development
5. Create repository pattern wrappers
6. Document query patterns for team

**Timeline**: 1 week
**Owner**: @backend-team

## Validation Criteria

**Success Metrics**:
- Query performance < 50ms (p95)
- Type safety: 100% of queries type-checked
- Developer onboarding: <30 min to run DB locally
- Migration workflow: <5 min to create and apply

**Review Date**: 2025-11-26 (1 month post-implementation)

## Notes

**Lessons Learned**:
- Benchmarked all three options with realistic queries
- Drizzle Studio was a game-changer for local development
- Zero runtime overhead is measurable (~20ms improvement vs Prisma)

**Open Questions**:
- Monitor Drizzle's roadmap for features like advanced relations
- Evaluate if we need to build custom query utilities
